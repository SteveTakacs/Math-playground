# Math-playground
A collection of famous mathematical problems and their solutions, explored through Python simulations and code.

In this collection we will see a simulation for the following Math problems:

1/ Monty Hall problem (in 3 version)
-Original (Choosing between 2 Doors, while starting with 3)
-With 1000 Doors (Choosing between 2 Doors, while starting with 3)
-With French Cards (Choosing between 2 Doors, while starting with 3)

(In the last 2 example our "gut feeling" is more accurate than with the original game, telling us that we should switch)

2/ The effect of seving in squash
If we assume that between 2 equal players, a serve means 5% advantage, will starting always mean that the player has 55% chance of winning? Or will the effect of serving accumulate to an even bigger advantage?

3/ Ladybug problem
Let's assume, we have an old wall clock, with markings between 1 and 12. 
Let's also assume that we have a ladybug on the clock, and that the ladybug can only move to the next marking in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction with 50-50% chance.

Now let's follow the movements of the ladybug! Whenever the ladybug reaches a marking, let's color that marking to know that the ladybug has been there.
The questions we want to answer is: What is the percentage for each marking to be the last marking (lastly colored) that the ladybug visits?
The ladybug starts at marking 12, so 6 is the furthest away and from 12 it can move to either 1 or 11 with equal probability.

An example for ladybug movements: 12 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 9 -> 8 -> ...

A very good explanation of the problem can be found in this video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/t3jZ2xGOvYg
